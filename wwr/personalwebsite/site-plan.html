      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is to draw attention to issues of Food waste in the united states. My goal with the site is to make a connection with consumers and farmers to better manage this issue. 
        My goal is to add partnerships with local farmers. These things can include private transactions or registering for things like farm shares. It would include links to local foodbanks that are in the area.
        My site will have links that allow a person to view events in the area, giveaways, and have links to other webpages or social media belonging to farmers. 
         </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience will primarily be lower income to middle class consumers. It is a site that appeals mostly to people that live in medium to large demographic areas. It will aim to also educate the public through short stories of farmers and the issues affecting farming and farming practices. I will allow local foodbanks and newer farmers to partner with us and to use it as a 
        marketing tool to help them get their products out. The wording on my site will be simple and through our learning links will aim to simplify difficult words and educate customers on what to look for as they shop.

        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      
      <h4> Why will people come to your site?</h4>
      <p> I think people will come to my site for good deals on produce as a way to save money. compared to the competition, my 
        site aims to be more user friendly and it allows the user to search their geographic location for local farmers and 
        food banks that are associated with our program.
      </p>

      <h4>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h4> 
      <p> I think my site more than anything will connect people to local growers and food programs that can save them money.
        It does this by posting information about other businesses and organizations. A user will quickly be able to see
        my site as a reference. There will be some links that will be more informative about the problem of food waste. 
        These links will also help a user understand what to buy and what not to buy when shopping for nonmarket produce 
      </p>

      <h4> What type of activities will vistors want to complete on your site </h4>
      <p> The first thing the user is invited to do is to input their location to find personalized items based on location.
        The user will also be encouraged to view volunteer links and to learn more about the issue through educational links.
      </p>
      
      <h4> What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? </h4>
      <p> To complete the actions on my site, a person needs to simply click on buttons within the site. Email and other things will be handled seperately. There will be a button for a user to input 
        their location, and buttons to access articles or updates. The pages will mostly hold contact information to other businesses
        There are also links in the footer that link to a more general social media search. 
      </p>
      <h4> Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions? </h4>
      <p>
        My website strives to be more user friendly. Through our educational links we aim to teach and simplify words to ensure the user looks for the best items available. Other sites are more complicated
        and assume that you know what to look for, our site aims to help the user make good decisions and connects them to the right resources they may need.
