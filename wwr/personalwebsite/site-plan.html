      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of my website is to draw attention to issues of Food waste in the united states. My goal with the site is to make a connection with consumers and farmers to better manage this issue. 
        My goal is to add partnerships with local farmers. These things can include private transactions or registering for things like farm shares. It would include links to local foodbanks that are in the area.
        My site will have links that allow a person to view events in the area, giveaways, and have links to other webpages or social media belonging to farmers. 
         </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My intended audience will primarily be lower income to middle class consumers. It is a site that appeals mostly to people that live in medium to large demographic areas. It will aim to also educate the public through short stories of farmers and the issues affecting farming and farming practices. I will allow local foodbanks and newer farmers to partner with us and to use it as a 
        marketing tool to help them get their products out. The wording on my site will be simple and through our learning links will aim to simplify difficult words and educate customers on what to look for as they shop.
